                I’ve been in construction for over 10 years, starting with residential remodels in the
                Tahoe area. I later attended California State University, Sacramento, where I studied
                Construction Management with a minor in Business.
              </p>

              <p class="muted">
                While in school, I worked with MJB Homes, Inc. and gained hands-on construction management
                experience across the full residential building process—design coordination, planning,
                permitting, construction, and final inspections. That experience continues to shape how I
                approach projects today.

          <h2>Why Calterra Homes</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            I started Calterra Homes because I genuinely love the construction industry and saw an
            opportunity to improve the experience homeowners have when working with contractors.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Poor communication, unclear scope, and unrealistic expectations create unnecessary stress
            during what should be an exciting process. Our goal is to provide a building experience that
            feels organized, transparent, and professionally managed from start to finish.
          </p>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top: 14px;">
          <h2>How We Do Our Best Work</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We do our best work when projects are thoughtfully planned and expectations are clearly defined
            from the beginning. Clear communication, realistic planning, and early decision-making allow
            projects to move efficiently and reduce unnecessary stress.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Every project begins under different circumstances, but the goal remains the same: bring
            structure, clarity, and professionalism to the process so homeowners feel informed and
            confident throughout the build.
